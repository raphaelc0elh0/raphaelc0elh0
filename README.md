# Hello World 👋

I'm a web developer from Brazil, who loves business, and is currently open to work. I'm now making a carrer change, and I'm searching for an opportunity to enter the technology market as a fullstack developer.

##  📖 A litle bit of context

I have a <em>nautical science bachelor degree</em> and worked as Merchant Navy Officer for 5 years, onboard international flagged vessels, where I could meet and work together with worldwide crew.

I started to learn coding from [Alura](https://github.com/alura-cursos)'s PHP and Ruby courses in 2019, because I wanted to create an ERP for my company [Hostel4Pets](https://github.com/hostel4pets). I learned all on my free time onboard and on vacations. From there, we got bigger and bigger, I stopped sailing, and I switched the stack entirely to Typescript (ReactJs/Node.js), which is the language I mainly code nowadays.

In 2022, as my company got a bit more independent, I started taking [RocketSeat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) courses, where I could leverage my skills for production ReactJS and Node.js environments, and started to pursue this new carreer.

## 💡 More about me
* I speak in English and Portuguese
* Found [Hostel4Pets](https://github.com/hostel4pets), which is one of the best (if not the best 🤩) dog boarding and daycare companies in Recife, Brazil
* While in college, I volunteered on our newsblog([Jornal Canal 16](http://jornalcanal16.com.br/)) as writer and developer of our website's first version, using wordpress
* I graduated as first of my class and, as a prize, I had been on an exchange program in Denmark for 6 months, to complete my nautical education
* Fun fact: I have a good sense of humor, love jokes, but I'm a bit of an introspect at first

## 🙋‍♂️ Why hire me?
I am looking forward to absorb knowledge 🧠, gain experience 🏭, collaborate 🤝 and build amazing products 🏭 for the world 🌍!
