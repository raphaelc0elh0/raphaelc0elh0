## Hello World 👋

I'm a web developer from Brazil, who loves business, and is currently open to work. I'm now making a carrer change, and I'm searching for an opportunity to enter the technology market as a fullstack (front or backend as well) junior developer. I'm also working at my own company [Hostel4Pets](https://github.com/hostel4pets), where I built our own ERP from scratch using ReactJs/Node.js stack. But, I'm willing to learn any stack if needed.

##  📖 A litle bit of context

I have a <em>nautical science bachelor degree</em> and worked as Merchant Navy Officer for 5 years, onboard international flagged vessels, where I could meet and work together with worldwide crew.

I started to learn coding from [Alura](https://github.com/alura-cursos)'s PHP and Ruby courses in 2019, because I wanted to create an ERP for my company [Hostel4Pets](https://github.com/hostel4pets). I learned all on my free time onboard and on vacations. From there, we got bigger and bigger, I stopped sailing, and I switched the stack entirely to Typescript (ReactJs/Node.js), which is the language I mainly code nowadays.

In 2022, as my company got a bit more independent, I started taking (RocketSeat)[https://github.com/Rocketseat] courses, where I could leverage my skills for production ReactJS and Node.js environments, and started to pursue this new carreer.

## 💡 What do I do and what have I done?
* Found [Hostel4Pets](https://github.com/hostel4pets), which is one of the best (if not the best 🤩) dog boarding and daycare companies in Recife, Brazil
* In [Hostel4Pets](https://github.com/hostel4pets), I'm not only coding, but I'm responsible for managing our social media accounts (10k plus followers [@hostel4pets](https://www.instagram.com/hostel4pets/)), creating content and marketing campaigns, designing illustrations using Adobe Illustration and Photoshop, editing videos and so on. Nothing is impossible to get the results we need!!!
* While in college, I volunteered on our newsblog([Jornal Canal 16](http://jornalcanal16.com.br/)) as writer and developer of our website's first version, using wordpress
* I graduated as first of my class and, as a prize, I had been on an exchange program in Denmark for 6 months, to complete my nautical education
* I try to think long-term in all aspects of my life, including finance and health, so:
  * I like to live a healthy life and my routine includes gym and cycling (not so often as I would like)
  * I have a good understanding of stocks, bonds, funds and etc. And currently have a long-term focused investment portfolio
  * I consume a lot of business, entrepreneurship and investments content 24/7
